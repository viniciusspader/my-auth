# My-Auth App

## Introduction

This is a app that I'm using to learn Ruby on Rails.  
My intent with this app is to build a base app to use in future projects.

## What does it has?

Im using a very basic configuration that can allow the app to be flexible
for future projects. I'm using some premisses and tools as follow:

+ User model: This app has only one model (not quite right) that is called User.
This model has no additional attributes, just the ones created by [Devise][1].

+ [Devise][1]: I'm using it for the authentication process. The configuration is
very basic
